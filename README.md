Android remote control app using SSH to generate alarm clock entries on a remote server with crontab. For stopping the alarm, a qr code must be scanned. The command for triggering and stopping the alarm, as well as the qr code value can be configured in the settings. The app is especially useful for setups in which a linux server (e.g. a raspberry pi media server) is connected to a stereo. The app then makes it usable as an alarm clock which can only be turned of by standing up and running to the qr code to turn it off.
